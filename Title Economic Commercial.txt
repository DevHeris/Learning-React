Title: Economic, Commercial, and Social Values of Biochemistry in Nigeria

Introduction

Biochemistry, the study of chemical processes within and related to living organisms, plays a pivotal role in various fields, contributing significantly to economic, commercial, and social development. In Nigeria, the application of biochemistry extends beyond the laboratory, influencing critical sectors such as energy, agriculture, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. This paper explores the economic, commercial, and social values of biochemistry in Nigeria, highlighting its potential to drive growth, innovation, and societal well-being.

Economic Impact

Biofuels Development

One of the promising economic contributions of biochemistry in Nigeria is the development of biofuels. The production of biofuels, such as ethanol from cassava, offers a viable alternative to fossil fuels, reducing the country's dependence on imported energy and contributing to energy security. Cassava, abundantly grown in Nigeria, can be processed into ethanol, creating a sustainable energy source that not only generates revenue but also provides employment opportunities in rural areas. Research indicates that biofuels can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global sustainability goals (Adejumo et al., 2021). The government's investment in biofuel research and development can further enhance this sector's growth, promoting economic stability and environmental conservation.
The development of biofuels from cassava offers a sustainable and economically beneficial alternative to fossil fuels. According to a study by Elemike, Oseghale, and Okoye (2015), cassava cellulosic waste, which is a by-product of starch processing, can be efficiently converted into bio-ethanol. The study showed that a combination of enzymatic and acid hydrolysis was effective in recovering significant amounts of starch and cellulose, which were then fermented to produce ethanol. Specifically, the process yielded 2.7 grams of ethanol from 15 grams of cassava cellulosic waste, indicating that cassava waste could be a valuable raw material for biofuel production (Elemike et al., 2015). This advancement not only reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels but also provides a new revenue stream for cassava farmers and processors, thereby enhancing rural economies and contributing to Nigeria's overall economic growth.

  Improved Post-Harvest Storage
  
Biochemistry also plays a crucial role in improving post-harvest storage, addressing one of the significant challenges faced by Nigerian farmers. Post-harvest losses, estimated at 20-30% of total agricultural production, result in substantial economic losses and food insecurity (FAO, 2020). Biochemical innovations in storage solutions, such as the development of natural preservatives and enhanced packaging materials, can reduce spoilage and extend the shelf life of perishable goods. For instance, the use of edible coatings derived from natural polymers can preserve the freshness of fruits and vegetables, thereby increasing food availability and reducing economic losses for farmers (Ibrahim & Musa, 2022).

The reduction of post-harvest losses in maize production is crucial for economic stability and food security in Nigeria. According to a study by Agoda et al. (2011), significant losses occur during post-harvest handling due to inadequate storage facilities and pest infestation. The study emphasizes the economic importance of reducing these losses by improving storage methods and constructing warehouses designed to mitigate grain spoilage and maintain quality (Agoda et al., 2011). Such improvements not only preserve the market value of maize but also enhance food availability and affordability, contributing to economic growth and stability.

    Commercial Impact

Biopharmaceutical Industry Growth

The biopharmaceutical industry in Nigeria holds immense potential for economic growth. Biochemistry is at the core of drug discovery and development, enabling the creation of new medications and vaccines that address prevalent diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Nigeria's investment in biopharmaceutical research can lead to the production of locally manufactured drugs, reducing reliance on imports and ensuring a steady supply of essential medicines. The establishment of biopharmaceutical manufacturing plants can also create high-skilled jobs and stimulate economic activity. The success of the Nigerian biopharmaceutical industry hinges on supportive policies, investment in research infrastructure, and collaboration with international partners (Eze, 2023).
The study by Isola and Mesagan  examines the relationship between market structure and performance in the Nigerian pharmaceutical sector. It highlights that market structure, rather than operational efficiency, significantly influences industry performance. The research underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks and market conditions in enhancing local pharmaceutical firms' capacity to produce quality drugs domestically. Importantly, the study recommends strategic interventions by the government to foster growth and eliminate challenges like counterfeit drugs, which affect market integrity and consumer trust (Isola & Mesagan).

  GMOs in Agriculture

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) present a transformative opportunity for Nigerian agriculture. Biochemistry facilitates the development of GMOs that can increase crop yields, improve resistance to pests and diseases, and enhance nutritional content. The adoption of GMOs can lead to significant economic benefits, including increased agricultural productivity and reduced costs associated with chemical pesticides and fertilizers. However, the introduction of GMOs must consider societal concerns and regulatory frameworks to ensure safety and public acceptance. Studies have shown that GMOs can contribute to food security and economic resilience if implemented with proper oversight (Olowe et al., 2021).
Caplan (2001) argues against the widespread adoption of genetically engineered crops due to concerns about safety, environmental impact, and socio-economic consequences. The chapter highlights the ethical and regulatory challenges surrounding GMOs, emphasizing the need for caution in their deployment. Caplan critiques the current agricultural practices dependent on chemical inputs, advocating for sustainable alternatives and suggesting that the long-term viability of GMO solutions remains uncertain. This perspective contrasts with industry narratives of increased productivity and reduced pesticide use associated with GMO adoption.
